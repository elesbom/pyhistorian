To install pyhistorian you just need to have setuptools installed (it's a dependency).

There is just a little step to install pyhistorian, and it is:
$ python setup.py install # maybe you must be root

Now you can use pyhistorian!

If you don't have setuptools installed or don't want to download it, you can just copy the pyhistorian.py file to your python site-packages directory.
For example:
$ cp pyhistorian.py /usr/lib/python2.5/lib/site-packages

Enjoy it!
